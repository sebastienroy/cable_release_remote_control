A cable release, also known as a threaded cable release, is a device used to actuate the shutter of a camera without touching the shutter button. It consists of a flexible wire moving within a sheath, with a threaded connector on one end, an a plunger on the other.  
The cable release is a purely mechanical device, as opposed to an electronic remote shutter release.
